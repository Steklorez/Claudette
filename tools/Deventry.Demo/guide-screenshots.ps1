<#
.SYNOPSIS
Takes the user guide's screenshots (Windows): the demo from deventry-demo in the Standard style, dark and light, each
picture cropped to the part of Deventry the page describes.

.DESCRIPTION
GUIDE.md ("Pictures") says what the pictures are. Each shot is a name (<chapter>/<picture>), the steps to it and the part of the window
to crop to, from the control's UI Automation bounds with a margin; it's saved as <Out>\<chapter>\<picture>-<theme>.png.
Each shot is taken in every theme at the same moment: Deventry's theme is switched between them (the command channel's
appearance), so the steps to it run once. It starts Deventry on the demo (fake-claude as Claude Code, so no account and
no tokens) four times:
- signed out (FAKE_CLAUDE_LOGGED_IN=0), for the sign-in screen;
- as the demo is, after visiting every tab so each shows its model and any reviewed icon, for the shots that leave it
  alone: the new tab picker, the sidebar, a tab's info card, the command palette, a Tool calls card, the composer, the
  Changed files, Scratch pad and Project tool windows, a Files tab, the Usage window, the Settings window on General,
  Appearance, a search, Unreal Engine's page in Project tools, About and Accounts, and a tab's Tab settings;
- with a stand-in for the Unreal editor open on starfall (deventry-demo --stand-in-editor, run as UnrealEditor.exe),
  for its log under the tab and in the main area;
- and last, for the shots that change it by sending prompts: a usage limit (LIMIT), a turn that changed files (EDIT_FILE),
  a permission waiting (ASK_PERMISSION) and a process for the process monitor (SPAWN).
Deventry is closed by its window, as a user would, each time. Rather than pausing for a fixed time, a step waits for
what the next one needs, or for the window to stop changing (Wait-Settled), and so does each picture.

A run leaves you the focus, the keyboard and the pointer, so you can carry on working meanwhile, a fullscreen app
included (DESIGN.md §9, "Taking screenshots without the focus"). Deventry runs with DEVENTRY_UNFOCUSED=1, its windows
behind yours and never taking the focus, and is driven through its command channel (DEVENTRY_AUTOMATION_PIPE): its
controls are found through UI Automation, and clicked, typed in and so on by Deventry itself. Captures go through
PrintWindow, which doesn't need the windows in view. Screenshots.psm1 has the helpers.

.PARAMETER Projects
Where the demo's git repositories go. The conversation shows their paths, so choose a short one that says nothing
about you, such as C:\Demo. It must be empty, or one deventry-demo made.

.PARAMETER Only
The shots to take, by name (tabs/sidebar) or chapter (tabs). Every shot by default.

.PARAMETER Themes
The themes to take them in.
